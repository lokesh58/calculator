# calculator

A calculator that calculates an expression.
eg : 2 + 3 * 4 / 7

In this we have two classes :
1) Stack : It contains three functions insert, pop and top.
2) Calculator : It contains a calculate function which can calculate an postfix expression.

We create the postfix expression in main() and then insert it into the calculator class object.
